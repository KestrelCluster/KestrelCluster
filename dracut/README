Dracut is a new initramfs infrastructure, very well designed and very efficient.

    http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Dracut
    
    Ubuntu's casper or Debian's live-initramfs are great live modules for the
    initramfs-tools, but also are very complex, and designed with live cd in
    mind. 
    We don't need so much features, since our live nodes will have only a bunch
    of services, and we look for a simple and clean solution (KISS).
