A config script is executed when we need to apply some configuration change.


nfs4_export-image                                    (applies to the frontend)

   This script creates a new entry in the /etc/exports file for exporting
   "${image_name}" image.
   It also creates an entry in the /etc/fstab file, since nfs4 requires the
   exported directories to be mount binded to the exported directory.
   Automatically detects the nfs4 root export and places the node images on it.


nfs4_home-fstab_chroot                             (applies to the node image)

   Adds an entry on the fstab file, to mount the nfs4 exported home directory.
   Automatically detects the nfs4 root export and places the home on it.


system_kestrel-rpc_chroot                          (applies to the node image)

   Install the RPC client.


tftpboot_add-image                                   (applies to the frontend)

   Creates the pxelinux config file for booting into the configured image.


ganglia_monitor_chroot                             (applies to the node image)

   This script reconfigures the gmond config file of the nodes :
     - Sets gmond's user to ganglia
     - Sets gmond to deaf mode. A node doesn't listen to other nodes.
     - Sets gmond's cluster info : name, owner, latlong and url
     - Sets udp_send_channel to unicast instead of multicast


system_beep-on-startup_chroot                      (applies to the node image)

   Changes the starting up beep melody (customizable using the variable $BEEP).


system_hostname_chroot                             (applies to the node image)

   Changes the default hostname of image node. The hostname will be :
   ${KESTREL_HOSTNAME}-${image_name}-unset.
   Afterwards the dhcp client will set the registered one.
