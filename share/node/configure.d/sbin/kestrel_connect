# This script is responsible for notifying the frontend via a rpc call that the 
# node is being start up.
#
# The node notifies the frontend :
#
#    - the num of real cpus (using the command "num-of-cpus")
#    - the node image (reading the file /etc/kestrel_image_name)
#    - the node group while being registered (reading the cmdline)
#
#
# Note : Do NOT modify this file! 
#
# This file depends on the frontend's ip and port, and it is recreated each time
# the image is reconfigured.
